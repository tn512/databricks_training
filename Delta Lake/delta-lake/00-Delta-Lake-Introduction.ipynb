    "[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is an open storage format used to save your data in your Lakehouse. Delta provides an abstraction layer on top of files. It's the storage foundation of your Lakehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Delta Lake?\n",
    "\n",
    "Running ingestion pipeline on Cloud Storage can be very challenging. Data teams are typically facing the following challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hard to append data *(Adding newly arrived data leads to incorrect reads)*\n",
    "* Modification of existing data is difficult (*GDPR/CCPA requires making fine grained changes to existing data lake)*\n",
    "* Jobs failing mid way (*Half of the data appears in the data lake, the rest is missing)*\n",
    "* Real-time operations (*Mixing streaming and batch leads to inconsistency)*\n",
    "* Costly to keep historical versions of the data (*Regulated environments require reproducibility, auditing, governance)*\n",
    "* Difficult to handle large metadata (*For large data lakes the metadata itself becomes difficult to manage)*\n",
    "* “Too many files” problems (*Data lakes are not great at handling millions of small files)*\n",
    "* Hard to get great performance (*Partitioning the data for performance is error-prone and difficult to change)*\n",
    "* Data quality issues (*It’s a constant headache to ensure that all the data is correct and high quality)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Theses challenges have a real impact on team efficiency and productivity, spending unecessary time fixing low-level, technical issues instead on focusing on the high-level, business implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Delta Lake solves all the low level technical challenges saving PB of data in your lakehouse, it let you focus on implementing simple data pipeline while providing blazing-fast query answers for your BI & Analytics reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Delta Lake being a fully open source project under the Linux Foundation and adopted by most of the data players, you know you own your own data and won't have vendor lock-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delta Lake capabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think about Delta as a file format that your engine can leverage to bring the following capabilities out of the box:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ACID transactions\n",
    "* Support for DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE\n",
    "* Unify batch & streaming\n",
    "* Time Travel\n",
    "* Clone zero copy\n",
    "* Generated partitions\n",
    "* CDF - Change Data Flow (DBR runtime)\n",
    "* Blazing-fast queries\n",
