    "\n",
    "Now that have created the Mosaic AI Tools in Unity Catalog, we will leverage the Mosaic AI Agent Framework to build, deploy and evaluate an AI agent for Prescriptive Maintenance. The Agent Framework comprises a set of tools on Databricks designed to help developers build, deploy, and evaluate production-quality AI agents like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Moreover, Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation provides a platform to capture and implement human feedback, ground truth, response and request logs, LLM judge feedback, chain traces, and more.\n",

During deployment, databricks.agents.deploy creates an M2M OAuth token with access to the resources specified in the resources parameter, and deploys it to the deployed agent. For the DBSQL [vector_search function](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/vector_search.html) automatic authentication passthrough is supported.

Therefore, we have to reference the secret in the model serving by specifying the secrets-based `environment vars`. This allows credentials to be fetched at serving time from model serving endpoints (see [Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/store-env-variable-model-serving.html#add-secrets-based-environment-variables))."
